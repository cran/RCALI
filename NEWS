On the result-file:
-------------------
* Add the grid steps on the first line of the result-file,
  when the method is grid.
* The value ALL is no more allowed for OUTPUT_FILE_FORMAT:
 the execution times are never written; 
 when the method is grid, the results for each replication 
 are no more written.
* All the results for a pair of polygons are written on a single
  line.
* When the first and second polygons of the pair are not the same,
  the results are no more repeated.

About the  function "getRes":
-----------------------------
* The return of the "getRes" is no more a list, but a data.frame.

In the function "califlopp":
---------------------------
* Add the parameters "warn.poly" and "warn.conv" to the
  function "califlopp" 
* The function "califlopp" never returns results: it is in charge
  of the user to call "getRes".
* The maximum number of  dispersion functions is 5 instead of 3.
* Fix a bug when the dispersion function numbers were not 
  consecutive numbers from 1.
* Improve the help-file; in particular, add the default values of 
  abser, reler, etc,..; explain how to compile and load dispersion
  function when in C/C++; detail the content of the result-file.

Miscellaneous:
---------------
* Add the function "sourceDir", to load all the functions.
* Add the test: "paysage"
